curaplugins
===========

several curaplugins
not all are working, but most can work stand alone

skew adds a real 3d printing effect with dynamic z moves

skewdouble adds a real 3d printing effect with dynamic z moves

maxXY calculates the max XY values used in the gcode and draws a square to check if it hits the endstops

relative E converts E values to relative E values [doesn't work iirc]

remove infill removes all the infill after a certain layer
even when infill is set to 0 in cura, there is some infill created around overangs

thininfill makes infill lines thinner

travel2extrude converts all travel moves to printing moves [made by github.com/neut, thanks...!!!]
